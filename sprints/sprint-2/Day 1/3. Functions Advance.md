# Advanced JavaScript Functions

JavaScript functions are versatile and powerful, allowing developers to write complex logic in a modular, reusable way. Understanding advanced concepts and seeing how these concepts apply to real-life scenarios can significantly improve your coding skills. Below is an in-depth exploration of JavaScript functions, enhanced with more detailed explanations, examples, and practical applications.

## 1. First-Class Functions

In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures. This feature allows for higher-order functions, callbacks, and more.

**Example:**
```javascript
const sayHello = () => console.log('Hello!');

// Assigning a function to a variable
const greet = sayHello;
greet(); // Output: Hello!
```

**Real-Life Scenario:**
Imagine a shopping cart system where you have different discount strategies based on user roles (e.g., regular customer, VIP, employee). You can create discount functions and dynamically assign them based on the user's role.

```javascript
const regularDiscount = (total) => total * 0.9;
const vipDiscount = (total) => total * 0.8;
const employeeDiscount = (total) => total * 0.7;

function applyDiscount(total, discountFunction) {
    return discountFunction(total);
}

const userRole = 'VIP'; // This could come from user data

let discount;
if (userRole === 'VIP') discount = vipDiscount;
else if (userRole === 'Employee') discount = employeeDiscount;
else discount = regularDiscount;

const totalAfterDiscount = applyDiscount(100, discount);
console.log(totalAfterDiscount); // Output: 80 if the user is VIP
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Write a function named `greetUser` that takes a name as an argument and logs a greeting message. Assign this function to a variable and invoke it using the variable.

2. Create two functions, `add` and `multiply`. Assign these functions to variables and use them to perform operations on two numbers.

**Medium:**
1. Create a function named `applyTax` that takes a `total` and a function `taxFunction` as arguments. Create two tax functions, `basicTax` and `luxuryTax`, and apply them using `applyTax`.

2. Create a function `composeGreeting` that returns a greeting function based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening). Assign the returned function to a variable and invoke it.

**Advanced:**
1. Implement a function `dynamicCalculator` that can perform different operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) based on a function passed to it. Create the operations as functions and pass them dynamically to `dynamicCalculator`.

2. Create a modular system for a shopping cart where discount functions are assigned to different user roles (regular, VIP, employee) and dynamically applied based on the role.

## 2. Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are widely used in JavaScript, especially in functional programming.

**Example:**
```javascript
function repeat(n, action) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        action(i);
    }
}

repeat(3, console.log); // Output: 0 1 2
```

**Real-Life Scenario:**
Consider an analytics system that processes different types of data (e.g., sales, user behavior, error logs). You can use higher-order functions to generalize the processing logic and pass in specific processing functions as needed.

```javascript
function processData(data, processFunction) {
    for (const item of data) {
        processFunction(item);
    }
}

const salesData = [100, 200, 300];
const userBehaviorData = ['click', 'scroll', 'purchase'];

function processSales(sale) {
    console.log(`Processing sale of amount: $${sale}`);
}

function processUserBehavior(action) {
    console.log(`Processing user action: ${action}`);
}

processData(salesData, processSales);
processData(userBehaviorData, processUserBehavior);
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Create a higher-order function named `doTwice` that takes a function as an argument and calls it twice.

2. Write a function `logNumbers` that logs numbers from 1 to 5. Use a higher-order function to call `logNumbers` three times.

**Medium:**
1. Create a function `filterArray` that takes an array and a filtering function as arguments. Use this function to filter out even numbers from an array.

2. Write a higher-order function `forEachItem` that takes an array and a function, and applies the function to each item in the array.

**Advanced:**
1. Implement a higher-order function `calculate` that takes an array of numbers and a function that applies a specific operation (e.g., add, subtract) to each number. Use this to perform multiple operations on the array.

2. Create an analytics processing pipeline using higher-order functions. Implement functions for different data types (e.g., sales data, user actions) and pass them through the pipeline.

## 3. Closures

A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside of that scope. Closures are powerful for creating private variables and methods, and they are often used in event handlers, callback functions, and module patterns.

**Example:**
```javascript
function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter()); // Output: 2
```

**Real-Life Scenario:**
Imagine a website with a "Like" button. Each time the user clicks the button, the like count should increase. You can implement this using a closure to maintain the state of the like count.

```javascript
function createLikeButton() {
    let likes = 0;
    return function() {
        likes++;
        console.log(`You have liked this ${likes} times.`);
    };
}

const likeButton = createLikeButton();
likeButton(); // Output: You have liked this 1 times.
likeButton(); // Output: You have liked this 2 times.
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Write a function `createCounter` that returns a function that increments a counter each time it is called.

2. Create a closure that keeps track of how many times a button is clicked. Log the click count each time the button is clicked.

**Medium:**
1. Implement a function `createMultiplier` that takes a number and returns a function that multiplies any given number by the first number.

2. Write a function `createPasswordChecker` that takes a password and returns a function that checks if a given password matches the original password.

**Advanced:**
1. Create a banking system using closures where you can deposit, withdraw, and check balance using separate functions. Ensure that the balance is private and can only be accessed through the closure.

2. Implement a closure-based system for managing access levels in an application. Each level should have specific permissions that are accessible only through the closure.

## 4. Currying

Currying is a technique where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions that each take a single argument. This allows for more modular code and partial application of functions.

**Example:**
```javascript
function multiply(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return a * b;
    };
}

const multiplyByTwo = multiply(2);
console.log(multiplyByTwo(3)); // Output: 6
```

**Real-Life Scenario:**
Consider a web application that calculates the price of products based on dynamic factors like tax and discount. Currying allows you to create specialized functions by pre-setting these factors.

```javascript
function calculatePrice(tax) {
    return function(discount) {
        return function(price) {
            return price * (1 + tax) * (1 - discount);
        };
    };
}

const withTax = calculatePrice(0.2); // 20% tax
const withDiscount = withTax(0.1); // 10% discount
console.log(withDiscount(100)); // Output: 108
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Write a curried function `add` that adds two numbers. The function should return a function that takes the second number.

2. Create a curried function `greet` that takes a greeting and a name. The function should return a function that takes the name.

**Medium:**
1. Implement a curried function `calculateTotal` that takes tax, discount, and price as arguments. Use partial application to preset tax and discount values.

2. Create a curried function `buildUrl` that takes a protocol, domain, and path. The function should return a fully constructed URL.

**Advanced:**
1. Create a curried function `applyPromotions` for an e-commerce site that applies multiple promotions to a product's price. Allow partial application to preset certain promotions.

2. Implement a currying system for a task scheduler that schedules tasks based on priority, deadline, and task type. Each part of the task scheduling can be preset using currying.

## 5. Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining multiple functions to produce a new function. It allows you to create complex operations by composing simpler functions.

**Example:**
```javascript
const add = (x) => x + 2;
const multiply = (x) => x * 3;

const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));

const addThenMultiply = compose(multiply, add);
console.log(addThenMultiply(5)); // Output: 21
```

**Real-Life Scenario:**
In a data processing pipeline, you might need to transform data through multiple stages. Function composition allows you to build these stages as independent functions and then combine them.

```javascript
const parseData = (data) => JSON.parse(data);
const cleanData = (data) => data.filter(item => item.active);
const transformData = (data) => data.map(item => ({ ...item, score: item.score * 2 }));

const processPipeline = compose(transformData, compose(cleanData, parseData));

const rawData = '[{"name": "John", "active": true, "score": 10}, {"name": "Doe", "active": false, "score": 15}]';
const processedData = processPipeline(rawData);
console.log(processedData); 
// Output: [{ name: 'John', active: true, score: 20 }]
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Write two simple functions, `double` and `increment`, and create a function `doubleThenIncrement` that applies `double` and then `increment` to a number.

2. Implement a function `capitalize` that capitalizes a string and a function `exclaim` that adds an exclamation mark. Compose these two functions into `shout`.

**Medium:**
1. Create a series of functions to process a list of numbers: `square`, `subtractTen`, and `half`. Use function composition to apply these functions in sequence to an array of numbers.

2. Write a data processing pipeline for user data that includes functions for validation, cleaning, and transforming user input. Use composition to combine these steps.

**Advanced:**
1. Implement a complex function composition for a web form processing pipeline, which includes parsing input, validating data, formatting it, and finally submitting it.

2. Build a report generation system that uses function composition to aggregate data, format it, and export it as a report. Allow different steps to be composed dynamically based on report type.

## 6. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined. It is often used to create a new scope, particularly in the case of avoiding variable collisions in the global scope.

**Example:**
```javascript
(function() {
    console.log('This function runs immediately!');
})();
```

**Real-Life Scenario:**
In a large web application, you might have several scripts that could potentially conflict with each other. Wrapping your code in an IIFE ensures that variables and functions do not leak into the global scope.

```javascript
(function() {
    const app = {
        name: 'My App',
        version: '1.0'
    };
    console.log(`${app.name} version ${app.version} is running.`);
})();
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Write an IIFE that logs "Hello, World!" immediately upon execution.

2. Create an IIFE that initializes an application object with `name` and `version` properties and logs the initialization.

**Medium:**
1. Write an IIFE that accepts parameters and logs a personalized greeting. The IIFE should take a name as a parameter.

2. Implement an IIFE that generates a unique identifier for a session and logs it. Ensure that the identifier is not accessible outside the IIFE.

**Advanced:**
1. Create a modular system where different parts of an application are defined in separate IIFEs. Ensure that each module's variables do not interfere with others.

2. Develop a plugin system using IIFEs where each plugin can be independently initialized and executed without polluting the global scope.

## 7. Function Binding with `bind`, `call`, and `apply`

JavaScript provides methods to explicitly set the value of `this` in a function:

- **`bind()`**: Returns a new function with `this` permanently bound to a specific value.
- **`call()`**: Immediately invokes the function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually.
- **`apply()`**: Similar to `call`, but arguments are passed as an array.

**Example:**
```javascript
const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    greet: function(greeting) {
        console.log(`${greeting}, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
};

const anotherPerson = { name: 'Bob' };

person.greet.call(anotherPerson, 'Hi'); // Output: Hi, my name is Bob
person.greet.apply(anotherPerson, ['Hello']); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob

const boundGreet = person.greet.bind(anotherPerson);
boundGreet('Hey'); // Output: Hey, my name is Bob
```

**Real-Life Scenario:**
Imagine you are developing a user interface where buttons trigger different actions, but the actions need to be bound to the context of the UI component they belong to. You can use `bind` to ensure the correct `this` context.

```javascript
function UIComponent(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.buttonClicked = function() {
        console.log(`Button in ${this.name} was clicked.`);
    };
}

const header = new UIComponent('Header');
const footer = new UIComponent('Footer');

document.querySelector('#header-button').addEventListener('click', header.buttonClicked.bind(header));
document.querySelector('#footer-button').addEventListener('click', footer.buttonClicked.bind(footer));
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Write a function `greet` that logs a greeting message. Use `call` to change the context of `this` and log a greeting for different people.

2. Implement a function `describe` that describes a person. Use `apply` to pass the arguments as an array.

**Medium:**
1. Create a function `increment` that increases a counter. Use `bind` to permanently bind the function to a specific counter object.

2. Write a function `scheduleMeeting` that logs meeting details. Use `call` and `apply` to dynamically bind the context to different meeting objects.

**Advanced:**
1. Develop a UI component system where actions are dynamically bound to components using `bind`. Ensure that the correct context is maintained for each action.

2. Create a task management system where tasks are dynamically assigned to users. Use `call`, `apply`, and `bind` to ensure that tasks are executed in the correct context with the right data.

## 8. Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique where the result of an expensive function call is cached, so it can be returned quickly the next time the function is called with the same inputs. This is particularly useful in functions that perform heavy calculations.

**Example:**
```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
    const cache = {};
    return function(...args) {
        const key = JSON.stringify(args);
        if (cache[key]) {
            return cache[key];
        }
        const result = fn(...args);
        cache[key] = result;
        return result;
    };
}

const factorial = memoize(function(n) {
    if (n === 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
});

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120 (cached result)
```

### Exercises

**Beginner:**
1. Write a function `square` that returns the square of a number. Implement a memoization function that caches the result of `square`.

2. Create a memoized version of a simple addition function and test it with different inputs.

**Medium:**
1. Implement a memoized version of a Fibonacci function. Test it to see how the memoization improves performance.

2. Write a memoization function that can be applied to any given function. Use it to memoize a string reversal function.

**Advanced:**
1. Develop a memoized version of a complex mathematical function, such as a prime number checker. Ensure that the function handles large inputs efficiently.

2. Create a memoization system for a data processing pipeline where intermediate results are cached. Use this system to optimize the processing of large datasets.
