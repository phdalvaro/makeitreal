# Understanding How JavaScript Works

JavaScript is a powerful, high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. To truly understand JavaScript, it's essential to grasp how the language works under the hood, from the initial compilation process to the internals of the JavaScript engine.

## JavaScript Compilation

Despite being an interpreted language, JavaScript undergoes a compilation process before execution. This process is handled by the JavaScript engine, which compiles the code into machine-readable instructions.

### Steps of JavaScript Compilation:

1.  **Parsing**: The JavaScript engine first parses the source code, creating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the structure of the code in a tree-like format.
    
2.  **Bytecode Generation**: The AST is then converted into an intermediate representation known as bytecode. Bytecode is a lower-level, optimized code that the JavaScript engine can execute directly.
    
3.  **Optimization**: Modern JavaScript engines include a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which optimizes the bytecode during runtime based on the code's behavior.
    
4.  **Execution**: Finally, the bytecode is executed by the JavaScript engine's interpreter or JIT compiler.
    

## JavaScript Engine

A JavaScript engine is responsible for executing JavaScript code. The most well-known engines include V8 (used by Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used by Safari).

### Key Components of a JavaScript Engine:

-   **Parser**: Converts JavaScript code into an AST.
-   **Interpreter**: Executes the bytecode line by line.
-   **JIT Compiler**: Optimizes the code by compiling frequently used bytecode into machine code.
-   **Garbage Collector**: Manages memory by deallocating unused memory.

## Internals of the JavaScript Engine

### 1. **The Call Stack**

The call stack is a data structure used to manage the execution of functions. Each time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack.

### 2. **The Memory Heap**

The memory heap is where objects are stored. JavaScript dynamically allocates memory for objects, arrays, and functions in this area.

### 3. **Execution Context**

Each time a function is called, an execution context is created. This context contains information about the function's local variables, the `this` keyword, and the environment in which the function is executed.

### 4. **Garbage Collection**

The garbage collector automatically frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable or used in the code.

## Execution Context and Call Stack

### 1. **Global Execution Context**

When JavaScript code is executed, a global execution context is created. This context represents the global environment, where global variables and functions reside.

### 2. **Function Execution Context**

Each time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created. This context contains the function's local variables and parameters.

### 3. **Lexical Environment**

JavaScript uses lexical scoping, meaning that a function's scope is determined by its location in the source code. The lexical environment keeps track of variable bindings and their values.

### Example of Call Stack and Execution Context:

```javascript
function firstFunction() {
  console.log('Inside firstFunction');
  secondFunction();
}

function secondFunction() {
  console.log('Inside secondFunction');
}

firstFunction();
```
**Explanation:**

1.  The global execution context is created, and `firstFunction` is called.
2.  A new execution context for `firstFunction` is created and pushed onto the call stack.
3.  Inside `firstFunction`, `secondFunction` is called, leading to a new execution context being pushed onto the call stack.
4.  Once `secondFunction` finishes execution, its execution context is popped from the stack.
5.  Finally, `firstFunction` completes, and its execution context is removed from the stack.

## Execution Context in JavaScript

### What is an Execution Context?

An execution context is an abstract concept describing the environment within which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. It contains information about the code's environment, including variables, functions, the value of `this`, and the scope chain. Whenever JavaScript code runs, it's wrapped in an execution context, which provides the necessary context for execution.

### Types of Execution Contexts

1.  **Global Execution Context (GEC):**
    
    -   Created when the JavaScript engine starts executing your code for the first time.
    -   There is only one global context in any JavaScript program.
    -   This context is the default context and manages global variables, global functions, and anything outside of a function.
2.  **Function Execution Context (FEC):**
    
    -   Created whenever a function is invoked.
    -   Each function call generates its own execution context.
    -   Multiple function execution contexts can exist simultaneously, but only one is active at any time.
3.  **Eval Execution Context:**
    
    -   Created when code is executed inside an `eval` function.
    -   Generally avoided due to performance and security issues.

### Phases of Execution Context Creation

When the JavaScript engine processes code, it does so in two main phases:

#### 1. **Creation Phase (Parsing):**

In this phase, the JavaScript engine sets up the environment before executing the code. This includes:

-   **Global Object Creation**: For browsers, this is the `window` object.
-   **`this` Binding**: In the global context, `this` refers to the global object.
-   **Hoisting**: The engine allocates memory for variables and functions. For variables declared with `var`, they are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with `undefined`. Functions declared using function declarations are also hoisted, but the entire function definition is moved to the top.

```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
```
In the above example, `x` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined` during the creation phase, so the `console.log(x)` statement doesn't cause an error.

#### 2. **Execution Phase (Running):**

After the setup, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line. During this phase:

-   The actual values are assigned to variables.
-   Functions are invoked, and the corresponding execution contexts are created.

### Example of Execution Context Creation

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

var name = "Alice";
greet();
```

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1.  **Creation Phase:**
    
    -   `greet` is hoisted as a function, and its entire definition is available.
    -   `name` is hoisted with an initial value of `undefined`.
2.  **Execution Phase:**
    
    -   `name` is assigned the value `"Alice"`.
    -   `greet()` is invoked, which creates a new function execution context.
    -   Inside the function, the value of `name` is accessed, and `"Hello, Alice"` is logged to the console.

## Hoisting

### Hoisting with `var`

Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with `undefined`. This means you can reference a `var` variable before its declaration without causing an error, but it will return `undefined` until the assignment occurs.


```javascript
console.log(age); // undefined
var age = 25;
```

### Hoisting with `let` and `const`

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. This means that while the declaration is hoisted, the variables cannot be accessed before their actual declaration in the code. Attempting to access them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`. This behavior leads to the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.

```javascript
console.log(name); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'name' before initialization
let name = "Alice";
```

In this example, `name` is in the Temporal Dead Zone from the start of the block until the `let` declaration is reached.

## The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when variables declared with `let` or `const` are hoisted but not initialized. The TDZ starts from the beginning of the scope until the line of code where the variable is declared and initialized.

During the TDZ, any attempt to access the variable results in a `ReferenceError`.

### Example of Temporal Dead Zone


```javascript
{
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 10;
}
```

**Explanation:**

-   The `let` declaration of `x` is hoisted, but it is not initialized during the creation phase.
-   The TDZ exists from the start of the block until the `let x = 10;` statement is reached.
-   Attempting to access `x` within the TDZ throws a `ReferenceError`.

### Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in Hoisting

1.  **`var`:**
    
    -   Hoisted to the top of its scope.
    -   Initialized with `undefined`.
    -   Can be accessed before declaration without causing an error, but returns `undefined`.
2.  **`let` and `const`:**
    
    -   Hoisted to the top of their scope.
    -   Not initialized, leading to the TDZ.
    -   Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.

## Memory Management

### 1. **Allocation and Deallocation**

JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and deallocates it when they are no longer needed.

### 2. **Garbage Collection**

The garbage collector in JavaScript works on the principle of reachability. If an object is no longer reachable, it is considered garbage and is eventually collected.

### Example of Memory Management:


```javascript
function createObject() {
  const obj = { name: 'JavaScript' };
  return obj;
}

const myObject = createObject();
```

**Explanation:**

-   The object `obj` is allocated in the memory heap.
-   Once the function `createObject` returns, the reference to `obj` is stored in `myObject`.
-   If `myObject` is reassigned or goes out of scope, the garbage collector will clean up the memory used by `obj`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Lexical Environment

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'I am from outer';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();` 
```
**Explanation:**

-   `innerFunction` has access to `outerVariable` due to lexical scoping. The lexical environment of `outerFunction` is preserved and accessible to `innerFunction`.

### Example 2: Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(hoistedVariable); // Output: undefined
var hoistedVariable = 'I am hoisted';
``` 

**Explanation:**

-   Variables declared using `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means the declaration is moved to the top, but the assignment remains in place.

### Example 3: Closures


```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let counter = 0;
  
  return function() {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  };
}

const increment = createCounter();
console.log(increment()); // Output: 1
console.log(increment()); // Output: 2
```

**Explanation:**

-   The `increment` function forms a closure, retaining access to the `counter` variable even after `createCounter` has finished executing.
